notes


got a teaching job. just went to the head of department with a curriculum.



it takes many years to get good at things

give yourself enough time

use your skills to search new directions, blank slates is not useful


Don't judge yourself on how much you are getting done


The craft is spending the day looking for missign semicolons

ergonomics of learning
... enjoy the process


A lot of the good coding happens in a hammock
