# Computers for collaborative spaces

I want hardware for collaborative spaces.   
Input devices meant to be used by multiple people.   
Shared screen real estate. 

A screen on the back of my laptop. 
Canvases in Cafe's that reflect what you are working on. 
7 segment text display + keylogger, bluetooth.

Sharing a projection screen in a classroom. 
Multiple input devices connecting to the same computer. 



# Stickers - To put on the back of laptops

- Ask me what I am doing on my screen!
- Look over my shoulder
- Don't let this be a screen between us
- 



# Hardware

- extra headphone port with invitation to listen in
- local cafe radio broadcast, invite people to listen with you 
- local area analog radio, give people receivers 
- public screen signal broadcasting
